# üè† Scorecard Modeling for Home Loan Default Prediction

## üìå Objective

Develop a predictive model to assess the creditworthiness of home loan applicants and generate a scorecard to optimize risk and maximize profitability by identifying potential defaulters.

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Records**: ~20,000 borrowers
- **Features**: 26 total columns; 25 independent features analyzed
- **Feature Selection**: Variables with Information Value (IV) > 0.02 were retained.

### Key Features Used:
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: % of asset cost already paid as down payment
- **Disbursement Amount**: Total loan credited to borrower's account
- **Vintage in Business**: Months since loan account opened
- **Down Payment**: Amount paid before loan was sanctioned
- **Distance from Office**
- **Asset Cost**
- **Tenure**: Loan repayment period in months
- **Years in Current Residency**
- **Earning Members**
- **FOIR**: Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio
- **Age**
- **Rate of Interest**

- Age 20‚Äì40 ‚Üí High risk if interest rate > 17%
- Age > 46 ‚Üí High risk if interest rate < 17%
- **Default Rate** highest among borrowers aged **>50 years**
